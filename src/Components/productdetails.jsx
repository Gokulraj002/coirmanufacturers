              high capacity for water retention, which is beneficial in
              horticulture and erosion control. Biodegradability: Coir is
              biodegradable and decomposes naturally,making it an
              environmentally friendly option.

              Certainly! Hereâ€™s a clearer version of the text: Coco pith is
              mixed with sand, compost, and fertilizer to create high-quality
              potting soil. It is also used for growing mushrooms due to its
              high cellulose content. One of the most attractive qualities of
              coco pith is its reusability, as it can be used up to three times,
              making it more sustainable than peat moss and other alternatives.
              Coco pith boasts excellent water retention properties, helping to
              keep plants hydrated for longer periods. Additionally, it improves
              soil aeration, which is crucial for root health and growth. This
              natural material is pH-neutral, reducing the risk of soil acidity
              issues that can harm plants.
